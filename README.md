# Hi!
<pre>
My name is Ethan Brown! I am currently working as a DevOps engineer at Blue Origin 
in our Lunar Permenance unit, where we are building a next-generation human-rated 
lunar lander for NASA. I spend my work hours building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, 
constructing and integrating API's, managing cloud infrastructure, and more. I spend 
my free time doing largely the same thing! I am passionate about space exploration 
and industrial development, public transportation, and internet infrastructure.
